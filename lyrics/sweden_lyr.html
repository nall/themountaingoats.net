if I've been untrue, I'm willing to pay. and darling if that's not enough I'll do anything you say. so darling please wherever you may be, hear my plea. and hurry home to me. I know without your love I just can't go on. I wonder where our love has gone. <h3><a name="crush"> deianara crush</a></h3> one day in september you come here. you pull my head down and you whisper in my ear. and you tell me the sidewalk is as far as the world really goes but that's a secret everybody knows. you hold my head in your hands. you say my name. how is it that though you say it some twenty thousand times it's never quite the same and you tell me that hercules died burning consumed by an article of his own clothing that's something I'd rather not be reminded of. <h3><a name="world"> whole wide world</a></h3> the last of the repercussions died off real slow and the sky was still and the cold sun sank down beneath the snow I hung by my hand from the tree outside and I looked at the whole wide world. when the voices came quietly. I shut them down. when a tricky young southerly wind came at me with its high whistling sound. I turned around to face it with real arrogance burning inside. and I drank in the whole wide world. <h3><a name="flashing"> flashing lights </a></h3> I am wearing a white long sleeved button-down. the pink colors behind the clouds tonight mirror the softer shades of your nightgown as the neuro-transmitters go crazy inside of me you swear you're leaving town empty promises empty promises. I am watching the way the wind seems to pass straight through your body. when you run your fingernail along my neck, you spill some water on me. you say you're as good as gone well, don't look now but here comes the dawn empty promises empty promises. empty promises empty promises. <h3><a name="xxx"> sept 19 triple x love! love!</a></h3> ...i bet you don't know... I cut down that withered peach tree just like you asked me to. and I hacked it into pieces set it on fire with your face in plain view at the near window where you stood watching me split the wood I will do as I am told. I will keep away the cold. the fire pit in the snow gave off a rich bright orange-red glow a familar scent rose up into the air and I remembered something special from a long time ago you opened up the door stepped away from the killing floor your footprint on the snow was fresh and new when you touched me I felt fire coming through I will do as I am told. I will keep away the cold. I will do as I am told. I will keep away the cold. <h3><a name="queens"> going to queens</a></h3> the ghostly sing-song of the children playing double-dutch. I felt the wind come through the window I felt it turn around and switch back. in the second story room in jamaica queens your hair was dripping wet. your skin was clean. and the children skipping rope tripled their speed you were all I'd ever wanted you were all I'd ever need. in new york city in the middle of july the air was heavy and wet the air was heavy, your body was heavy on mine. I will know who you are yet. I will know who you are yet. <h3><a name="maker"> tahitianambrosia maker</a></h3> we were real hungry and half dead when you broke out half a loaf of sourdough bread. and in the tropical air the scent rose like a spirit. moments of grace like this being wholly unmerited. ahh. we were newly alive and I felt your hand on my arm. I was awake to the sensation and immune from all harm. you pressed your soft cheek up against my gut. pure gold. nothing but gold,and I'm gonna bake you a nice coconut cream pie. 'cause I saw the sky coming down to meet you. <h3><a name="bolivia"> going to bolivia</a></h3> john: it is the only appliance that grinds the grain into flour and kneads the dough in the same container I cut myself a two-foot switch from some tropical hardwood nearby. and the sounds of a carnival drifted miraculously through the air from a thousand miles away. the monkeys jumped from tree to tree. it sent a deathly chill through me in bolivia wildcats I had never seen claimed places in my room. animal noises rang through the thick brush like voices from the tomb. I saw the freshly polished chrome gleaming in the mid-day sun. and I knew that you were coming home to bolivia. hey hey <h3><a name="tollund"> tollund man</a></h3> I was sitting at the edge of the marsh when the council came to bring me the news. they handed me a bowl of cooked wild grasses and they gave me the ceremonial shoes. goodbye young danish women. goodbye danish sky. goodbye cold air I am going away. goodbye goodbye goodbye. <h3><a name="california"> california song</a></h3> I know you see mars in the sky tonight I know you can see venus rising and veering off to the right. but can you see that young star overhead?
