<h3 id="damn_these_vampires">Damn These Vampires</h3>
Brave young cowboys
Of the near north side
Mount those bridge rails
Ride all night
Scream when captured
Arch your back
Let this whole town hear
Your knuckles crack

Sapphire Trans-Am
High beams in vain
Drive wild broncos
Down the plain
Push up to the corner
Where the turbines hiss
Someday we won't
Remember this

Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me
Tie those horses
To the post outside
And let those glass doors
Open wide
And in their surface
See two young, savage things
Barely worth
Remembering

Feast like pagans
Never get enough
Sleep like dead men
Wake up like dead men
And when the sun comes
Try not to hate the light
Someday we'll try
To walk upright

Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these bite marks
Deep in my arteries
Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me

<h3 id="birth_of_serpents">Birth of Serpents</h3>
Let the camera pull back till the fullness of the frame is clear and plain
Peer into the screen until you see it all like a vision in a crystal ball
Let it all fill with smoke
Is this somebody's idea of a joke?

Let the fixer work until the silver's washed away
And take the picture from the tray
Look hard at what you see and then remember you and me
And let the truth spring free
Like a jack-in the box
Like a hundred-thousand cuckoo clocks
From the Oregon corners to the Iowa corn
To the rooms with the heat lamps where the snakes get born

Crawl through the tunnel and follow, follow the light north west
See that young man who dwells inside his body like an uninvited guest
See the tunnel twist
Clutch your birth rite in your fist
Let the camera do its dirty work down there in the dark
Sink low, rise high, bring back some blurry pictures
to remember all your darker moments by
Permanent bruises on our knees 
Never forget what it felt like to live in rooms like these
From the California coastline to the Iowa corn
To the rooms with the heat lamps where the snakes get born

<h3 id="estate_sale_sign">Estate Sale Sign</h3>
Crude little wooden idols
And aviator shades
The trinkets and the treasures we brought back from the Crusades
Some guy in an Impala shakes his head when he rides by
But I remember when we shared a vision, you and I

Worked hard to build this altar
We made it earn its keep
The cracks across its surface spider web while we're asleep
The sacrificial stains all spreading out and soaking through
But I remember when we kept it pretty, me and you

And high above the water
The eagle spots the fish
Every martyr in this jungle
Is gonna get his wish

Stock shots stupid stock shots
From the Pomona mall
Set up like unloved icons gathering dust up on the wall
From films no one remembers
They call down silently
But I remember when their names were dear to you and me
Yeah

Pennies on the dollar
Everything's gotta go
The things that we can't even give away
I don't wanna know
Try to see if secrets burn when you hold them up into the light
I remember when we loved each other day and night

And high above the water
The eagle spots the fish
Every martyr in this jungle
Is gonna get his wish

<h3 id="age_of_kings">Age of Kings</h3>
Halls of the stone tower in the foothills
Why should we hide from anyone?
Held you in my arms for the first time that day
Felt like God's anointed when you didn't push me away

Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings

Lean on the concrete walls in shadow
Why should we wait to throw the switch?
Felt your name burn in like a tattoo into my skin
Rain on the clay tiles all night
Your head nestled beneath my chin

Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings

In the lost age
Where the jewels hide
And sword sticks in the waiting stone
Still warm

Small chambers shrinking til they vanish
Wolves in the hallway gaining ground
Reach down to the moment when I should've said something true
Shadows and their sources now stealing away with you

Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings 

<h3 id="the_autopsy_garland">The Autopsy Garland</h3>
One clear shot or else he gets away
Red sun high in the sky tonight
Look west from London down to old Hollywood
Remember the first days in california


You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on

Fat rich men love their 12-year-olds
Deco cufflinks and cognac by the glass
Look West from London toward the emerald city
Remember Minnesota

You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on

Or their gloves...

Sweet spearmint and bitter tangerine
Bedside decked with roses
Look West look West look West and look away
From old familiar faces

You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on 

<h3 id="beautiful_gas_mask">Beautiful Gas Mask</h3>
Come hard through the fog
Blindfolded and bound
Til we stand at the edge
Of a hole in the ground

We hold hands and we jump
And as we fall we sing
Paupers hammering the walls of the castle
Going to meet the king

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep

Crash in from deep space
Shot birds falling fast
Who will be there to catch us in his jaws
When we arrive alive at last?

I can't hear you in the dark
Wish I knew where you'd gone
Know you're there off in the shadow somewhere
Try to soldier on

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep
And breathe humbly

Secure your mouthpiece when you can
Toxic shapes adorn the walls
As we rise from our knees
Someone's coming to reward us, you wait and see
Or crush us both like fleas

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep

<h3 id="high_hawk_season">High Hawk Season</h3>
I heard the wings beat on the wind tonight
As the heat stole power from the darkening light
I saw the streets fill up with people that I knew
People who looked like you

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake
We are young supernovas and the heat's about to break

Drift through the streets, walk between the cars
Newborn sons and daughters spat forth from distant stars
The summer will reveal itself to those whose hearts are true
And to the faithless few

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake
We are young supernovas and the heat's about to break

Who will rise and who will sing?
Who's going to stand his ground and who's going to blink?
Surge forward from Van Cortlandt Park like frightened sheep
Spirit throngs that hoist us high, three thousand warriors deep
Spray our dreams on any surface where the paint will stick
Try to time the rhythm, listen for the click

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake
We are young supernovas and the heat's about to break 

<h3 id="prowl_great_cain">Prowl Great Cain</h3>
Gather jewels from graveyards, when I get home bury them again
Wonder if you'll ever get the chance to ask me why I turned you in
I saved my own skin but I live to fight, I live to fight another day
Still remember how brave you were when they came to take you away

And I feel guilty but I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Thought I'd seen the ghost up on the boulevard, between the broken bits
It's hard to tell gifts of the spirit from clever counterfeits.
Sleepwalk through my days and mark the hours until these dark times fade
Like a caterpillar crawling out along the surface of the blade

And I feel guilty but I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Rummage through the gutted storehouse now
And lick the sweat from my brow
Saw the trucks roll out this morning, not sure when they're coming back again
Feel the prickings of my conscience in my chest ever now and then

Sometimes a great wave of forgetfulness rises up and blesses me
And other times the sickness howls and I despair of any remedy

And I feel guilty but I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain 

<h3 id="sourdoire_valley_song">Sourdoire Valley Song</h3>
Bang the small rocks on the big ones
Til the small ones are sharp and clean
Catch something, kill something
New blade cuts real keen

And then the grass grows up to cover up
The firepit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge

Chew these roots for a toothache
Chew these ones for atmosphere
Dream the pleasant dreams that people dream
When they grow up down here

And then the grass grows up to cover up
The firepit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge

Take care of the old man
See if he's in pain
Have somebody stay with him
Comfort him when he complains

Keep to ourselves mostly
Few friends and fewer closer friends
Lead a long life if you're lucky
Hope it never ends

And then the grass grows up to cover up
The firepit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge 
<h3 id="outer_scorpion_squadron">Outer Scorpion Squadron</h3>
If you really want to conjure up a ghost
Cultivate a space for the things that hurt you most

Rake the sands until they surface
Bind their tiny eyes

Stake out your position, let your armor fall
Stay put til they find you, it won't take long at all

Rake the sands until they surface
Up they come, gone translucent

They're coming up no matter what
Fools rush in and the doors slam shut

Ghosts of my childhood stay with me, if you will
Find a place where there's water, hold you under til you're still

Rake the sands until they surface
Don't let anybody call them ugly 

<h3 id="for_charles_bronson">For Charles Bronson</h3>
Catch a lucky break, try to make it last
Rig a blanket curtain up between
the present and the past

Play my lucky numbers
for most of what they're worth
Lie about my age right down to my last day on this earth

Set your sights on good fortune
Concentrate
Pull back the hammer
Try to hold the gun straight

Hit the gym each night,
stay cool and seldom speak
Keep the heart of a champion
Never let them see you're weak

And whatever they say
on your page three mention
Focus on the parts that make you feel good
Be grateful for the attention

Set your sights on good fortune
Concentrate
Pull back the hammer
Try to hold the gun straight

Try to hold the gun straight
And true
And steady
Let the frame find you when the cameraman's ready

Work until I drop
Drift from place to place
Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania
scratched into my face

Set your sights on good fortune
Concentrate
Pull back the hammer
Try to hold the gun straight
Try to hold the gun straight 
<h3 id="never_quite_free">Never Quite Free</h3>
It's so good to learn that right outside your window
There's only friendly fields and open roads
And you'll sleep better when you think you've stepped back from the brink
And found some peace inside yourself; lay down your heavy load

It gets alright
to dream at night
Believe in solid skies and slate blue earth below
But when you see him, you'll know

It's okay to find the faith to saunter forward
There's no fear of shadows spreading where you stand
And you'll breathe easier just knowing that the worst is all behind you
And the waves that tossed the raft all night have set you on dry land

It gets okay
to praise the day
Believe in sheltering skies and stable earth beneath
But hear his breath come through his teeth

Walk thy faith
Tell no one what you've seen

It's so good to learn that from right here the view goes on forever
And you'll never want for comfort, and you'll never be alone
See the sunset turning red, let all be quiet in your head
And look about, all the stars are coming out

They shine like steel swords
Wish me well where I go
But when you see me, you'll know 
<h3 id="liza_forever_minnelli">Liza Forever Minnelli</h3>
There's the part you've braced yourself against and then there's the other part
Steal up inclining northward streets with some weird sickness in the dark

Saw your name on the sidewalk saw your brave face in my mind
If you're gonna sit next to the dealer you get to bet blind

Never get away never get away I am never ever gonna get away from this place
Lay down on the streets my eyes toward the sun your star next to my face

The compasses I came into this world with never really worked so good
Gentle shadows spilling down the hills up on Mulholland at Ledgewood

Turn back turn back find someone to tell your secrets to
Dream past an old hotel on Ivy and seconds later i saw you

Never get away never get away I am never ever gonna get away from this place
Lay down on the streets my eyes toward the sun your star next to my face

Let the camera track me from the footlights to the wings
Let me set aside an hour or two in memory of sweet things

Regrind the lens again and again and again and again but still the picture fips
Anyone here mentions "Hotel California" dies before the first line clears his lips

Never get away never get away I am never ever gonna get away from this place
Lay down on the streets my eyes toward the sun your star next to my face
